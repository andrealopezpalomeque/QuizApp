## Architecture 🏛️

The Quiz App follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture to ensure clarity and maintainability of the codebase. Here's a brief overview of each component:

- Model: The model represents the data and logic of the app. In this case, it manages the quiz questions, answers, and the user's score. 🗂️

- View: The view is responsible for presenting the user interface (UI) to the user. It displays the questions, answer buttons, and the score. 🖥️

- Controller: The controller acts as the intermediary between the model and view. It handles user interactions, updates the model with the user's answers, and updates the view accordingly. 🎮
