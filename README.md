- Scoring system: Each correct answer earns a score of 1, while incorrect answers do not affect the score.
- MVC architecture: The app is built using the Model-View-Controller architecture, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and maintainability.

## Prerequisites

- Xcode 12.0 or higher
- Swift 5.0 or higher

## Architecture

The Quiz App follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture to ensure clarity and maintainability of the codebase. Here's a brief overview of each component:

- Model: The model represents the data and logic of the app. In this case, it manages the quiz questions, answers, and the user's score.

- View: The view is responsible for presenting the user interface (UI) to the user. It displays the questions, answer buttons, and the score.

- Controller: The controller acts as the intermediary between the model and view. It handles user interactions, updates the model with the user's answers, and updates the view accordingly.
